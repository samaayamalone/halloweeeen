<h1>Some Spooky Facts</h1>
<img src="images/halloween.jpg" alt="halloween" width="800" height="auto">
<div>
  <p>has roots in the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain, where people lit bonfires and wore costumes to ward off ghosts. The early Christian church later incorporated some Samhain traditions into All Saints' Day (November 1st) and All Souls' Day (November 2nd), with the evening before known as All Hallows Eve, eventually evolving into Halloween. </p>
  </div>
  <h2 class="section-title">Origins in Samhain</h2>
  <div>
  <p>Samhain, a Gaelic festival, marks the end of summer and the harvest, and the beginning of the dark, cold winter. It's celebrated from the evening of October 31st to November 1st, and is considered a liminal time when the boundary between the worlds of the living and the dead is thin, allowing spirits to roam freely. This ancient Celtic tradition is the precursor to modern Halloween. </p></div>
  <h2 class="section-title">All Hallowsâ€™ Eve & Christian Influence</h2>
  <div>
  <p>All Hallows' Eve, or Halloween, has both pagan and Christian roots, with the Christian influence stemming from the celebration of All Saints' Day, also known as All Hallows' Day. The evening before, All Hallows' Eve, was traditionally a vigil period of prayer and fasting before the feast day. Over time, the holiday became a mix of Christian and pagan traditions, with some Christians embracing it while others have concerns about its origins and commercialization. </p></div>
  <h2 class="section-title">Traditions â€” Pumpkins & Trickâ€‘orâ€‘Treating</h2>
  <div>
  <p>Pumpkins and trick-or-treating are two popular Halloween traditions with roots in ancient customs and folklore. Carving pumpkins, or jack-o'-lanterns, originated with the Irish who used turnips to ward off spirits, while trick-or-treating evolved from ancient Celtic festivals and early Catholic practices, involving costumes and food offerings to appease spirits and eventually leading to the modern practice of going door-to-door for treats. </p></div>
